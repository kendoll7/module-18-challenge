The data used was from June of 2013 from CitiBike. 

Dashboards:
The first dashboard created shows the start and end stations on a map. 
The start station with the most usage is Central Park and South Ave.

The second dashboard created shows data visualizations based on gender. 
It is interesting to note that the percentage of male bikers is significantly higher than the number of females using the service, although the unknown category is larger than both categories and may change the result. In the bar graph of "Male vs Female Distance", females have an average travel time almost three minutes longer than men. The unknown category of gender has an average travel time of 29 minutes, which is 9 minutes more than the average travel time for women.

Visualizations:
1. Age vs. Trip Duration
- Based on the graph, the average trip for 29 years old is 30.30 minutes, longer than any of the other ages reported.
2. Trip Times by Gender
- We see that usage of CitiBikes at the beginning of June was relatively small compared to the later dates of the month.
3. Average Age per Station
- The average age of the CitiBike users ranges from 42 to 54. This seems interesting especially as 29 year olds showed longer biking durations, but the average age could be skewed by fake age inputs from users.
